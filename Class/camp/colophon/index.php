        <h1>Colophon</h1>
        <p class="colophon"> HTML 5 is the new outline for the internet and how most web pages will 
            be written with in the near future. It is makes accessibility even 
            better for web pages. It is easier for people to read because we have 
            the five main set ups for each page. The !DOCTYPE html makes it easier 
            to set up you page instead of before when you had to type a whole 
            bunch of mumbo jumbo stuff to set up the document. The code is a 
            lot more simple and easy to use and read. It makes it easier to 
            create a web page for different browsers and also to use with mobile
            phones as well.</p>
