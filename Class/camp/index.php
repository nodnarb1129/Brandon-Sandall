        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="colophon">Space Camp is based near Houston, Texas. It is a highly
            specialized summer camp for teens, ages 13-19. These teens qualify
            for involvement through a competitive process that focuses heavily 
            on academic interest in science, math, and physical fitness. These 
            teens usually express an interest in space, aeronautics, astronomy 
            and exploration. Many desire to be astronauts or work in space 
            related industries. The camp lasts 8 weeks. The cost is $4,000, 
            which can be paid through a competitive scholarship program. The 
            staff is comprised of current and past astronauts as well as 
            academics and other professionals from NASA and space related 
            industries.
