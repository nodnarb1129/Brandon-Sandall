        <h1>Style Guide</h1>

        <p>I plan on giving the web page a modernized look. I plan on having
           a space background. I want to give the feeling of a space prgrom.
           I will use drop down lists, pictures, and good descriptions as to how I
           want to portray the site. This is all so the user can get the look and
           feel of a space camp web site. The colors I will be using for the text for
           the web site are white. I will provide catchy drop down lists.
